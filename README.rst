TiddlyParse allows Python to interact with `TiddlyWiki`_.

At the moment it handles standalone HTML files, with the `two tiddler formats`_. The first one was used in version up to and including 5.1.23, the second one uses JSON snippets and is in use since 5.2.0.

The intent is to extend this library in the future to also seamlessly interact with a server-side TiddlyWiki and use the REST API in that context.
